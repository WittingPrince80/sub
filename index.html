    <h1>What is Subnatica: </h1>
        <p>Subnatica is a survival game in which the player character, Ryley Robinson is on a ship called the Aurora that is hit by a mysterious energy pulse causing the ship to crash on planet 4546B, a water planet. After the ship is hit but before it crashes a few people including
        the player gets in lifepods. Most life pods perish and kill whoever is in them and after they land only 3 people survive but within 3 hours two die leaving the player the only lone survivor.

After the player crashes, they explore the water world they scavenge for resources, scan blueprints, and make a base. Eventually a team called Sunbeam get the Aurora’s distress call and head to the planet and gives the location where Sunbeam will land. The landing spot is a small island and on the island is an alien base and when sunbeam comes to land the base turns out to be a giant gut that when the Sunbeam vessel came the gut blue it up. The player also explores the crashed Aurora and finds blueprints for an escape rocket then explores the alien base. The player then finds out the pulse that hit Sunbeam was the pulse that hit the Aurora and finds a button to turn the gun off but when they try to this thing stabs there had like a needle and doesn’t allow the button to be pushed then as the player gets out of the base there hand starts to get green then finds out that they have the Kararr virus and that the player needs to cure himself to turn of the gut and escape, otherwise the ship will get blown up. Then the player finds the See emperor leviathan which seeks to help the player get cured because the emperor produces enzyme 42 which is the cure but is too old to so the player needs to help her babes hatch and the baby leviathans can cure Kararr and after that is done and the gun is disabled the player gets of the planet.
